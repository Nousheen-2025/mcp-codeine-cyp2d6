# Codeine + CYP2D6 MCP

**Drug:** Codeine  
**Gene:** CYP2D6  
**Type:** Partial prodrug

## Key PGx Insight
- Codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6 into morphine (its active form).
- CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) may experience toxicity due to rapid conversion.
- Poor metabolizers (PMs) may get insufficient pain relief.

## Clinical Guidance
- Avoid codeine in CYP2D6 UMs and PMs.
- Consider alternatives like morphine or non-opioids.
